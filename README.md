# ASP_Testing

This project exists to show both my current abilities using asp.net/C# and as a storage for future updates.
The files included were created in visual studio 2010, and should be runnable in that program.

## Why isn't this hosted somewhere?

I do not currently have access to a webhost that supports asp.net/razor, and cannot afford to pay for one at this time.
